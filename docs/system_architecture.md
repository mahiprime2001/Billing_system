# Billing System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a comprehensive billing system that serves both merchants and users. The system enables merchants to send bills to users, who can receive notifications via SMS and view their bills in a web or mobile application. Additionally, the system includes a shopping list feature that helps users find merchants with desired items within a 10km radius.

- **Technology**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- **Key Data Entities**:
  - Users
  - Merchants
  - Bills
  - Payments
  - Inventory
  - Shopping Lists
  - Locations

#### Authentication Service
- **Purpose**: Handle secure two-factor authentication
- **Technology**: OAuth 2.0 with support for multiple authenticator apps
- **Features**:
  - Password-based first factor
  - Authenticator app-based second factor (Google, Microsoft, etc.)
  - JWT token management

#### Notification Service
- **Purpose**: Manage and send SMS notifications
- **Technology**: Integration with SMS gateway APIs (Twilio, etc.)
- **Features**:
  - Bill notifications
  - Payment reminders
  - Custom merchant notifications

### 2. Frontend Applications

#### Merchant Web Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Interface for merchants to manage bills, customers, and inventory
- **Technology**: TypeScript with Next.js
- **Key Features**:
  - Bill creation and management
  - Customer database
  - Inventory management
  - Payment tracking
  - Reporting and analytics

#### User Web Application
- **Purpose**: Interface for users to view bills and manage shopping lists
- **Technology**: TypeScript with Next.js
- **Key Features**:
  - Bill viewing
  - Payment recording
  - Shopping list management
  - Merchant discovery
  - Route mapping

#### Mobile Applications (Android & iOS)
- **Purpose**: Mobile interface for users
- **Technology**: React Native
- **Key Features**:
  - Same as web application
  - Native device integration
  - Offline capabilities
  - Push notifications

### 3. Integration Services

#### Geolocation Service
- **Purpose**: Handle location-based merchant discovery
- **Technology**: PostGIS with Google Maps API
- **Features**:
  - Radius-based merchant search
  - Route optimization
  - Distance calculation

#### Payment Tracking Service
- **Purpose**: Record and track various payment methods
- **Technology**: Custom payment tracking module
- **Features**:
  - Support for UPI, cards, cash
  - Split payment recording
  - Payment verification

## Data Flow

1. **Bill Creation Flow**:
   - Merchant creates bill in dashboard
   - System stores bill in database
   - Notification service sends SMS to user
   - User receives notification and views bill in app

2. **Payment Recording Flow**:
   - User makes payment to merchant
   - Merchant records payment details
   - System updates bill status
   - User receives confirmation

3. **Shopping List Flow**:
   - User adds items to shopping list
   - System queries merchant inventory within 10km
   - System identifies merchants with full or partial matches
   - System generates optimal route
   - User views suggested merchants and route
